## Slide 7: Business Model and Unit Economics

### Monetization model: pay per translated word

**Pricing plan:**

- **Base rate:** $0.003 per translated word
- **Corporate rates:** discounts from 10% for volumes over 1 million words per month
- **Included in the price:**
    - Automatic terminology extraction
    - Color marking of problematic segments
    - API access and integration with workflows

**Unit Economics Analysis:**

|Metric|Value|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Average client**|2,000,000 words/month|Typical volume for a medium translation agency|
|**Revenue per client**|$6,000/month|At the base rate of $0.003/word|
|**Annual revenue per client**|$72,000|ARR per average client|
|**Variable costs**|$0.0006/word|20% of the rate (computational resources)|
|**Gross margin**|80%|Percentage of profit after variable costs|
|**CAC**|$2,400|Cost of acquiring one client|
|**LTV**|$216,000|With an average client lifetime of 3 years|
|**LTV/CAC**|9.0|Target efficiency indicator >3|

**ROI calculation for the client:**

- **Client currently pays for translation:** $0.04-0.1/word
- **Our cost:** $0.003/word
- **Savings:** 93-97% (14-33 times cheaper!)

**With a volume of 2 million words/month:**

- **Traditional translation:** $80,000-$200,000/month
- **Our solution:** $6,000/month
- **Savings:** $74,000-$194,000/month (93-97%)
- **ROI:** 1,230-3,230% in the first year
